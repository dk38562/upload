			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Greek mythology consists of stories about heroes, rituals, and gods from ancient Greece. The most analytical Greeks, such as the philosopher Plato in the 5thâ€“4th century BCE, knew that the stories contained much fiction. But the majority of the Greek population accepted the myths as true stories. Greek mythology has significantly impacted Western civilization's arts and literature, which inherited much of Greek culture.</p>
			<p>Although written to explain the existence and workings of natural phenomena, recount the deeds of gods and heroes, or justify social and political establishments. The Greek myths are unrivaled in the Western world as sources of imaginative and exciting ideas. Throughout history, poets and artists have drawn inspiration from Greek mythology. They have found contemporary importance and relevance in Classical mythological themes.</p>
