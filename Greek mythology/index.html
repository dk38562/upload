		<p>Greek mythology is a collection of stories about ancient Greek gods, heroes, and rituals. The most critical Greeks, such as the philosopher Plato in the 5thâ€“4th century BCE, knew that the stories contained a significant amount of fiction. The myths, on the other hand, were generally accepted as true stories in Greek popular piety. Greek mythology has had a significant impact on Western civilization's arts and literature, which inherited much of Greek culture.</p>
		<p>Despite the fact that myths have been developed by people from all countries, eras, and stages of civilization to explain the existence and workings of natural phenomena, recount the deeds of gods or heroes, or justify social or political institutions, the Greek myths have remained unrivaled in the Western world as sources of imaginative and appealing ideas. Poets and artists have drawn inspiration from Greek mythology throughout history, and have found contemporary importance and relevance in Classical mythical themes.</p>
