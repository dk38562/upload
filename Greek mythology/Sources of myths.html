		<h1>Sources of myths: literary and archaeological</h1>
		<h3>The Iliad and the Odyssey</h3>
		<p>Homer and Hesiod, according to Herodotus, gave the Olympian gods their known traits around the 5th century BCE. Today, few people would take this literally. The son of Zeus and Leto (Apollo, line 9) is as easily recognized to the Greek reader by his patronymic as the sons of Atreus in the first book of the Iliad. The audience is assumed to be familiar with the mythology that preceded their literary representation in both situations. There is little evidence that the Greeks viewed Homer or any other source of Greek mythology as simply entertainment, but important Greeks from Pindar to the later Stoa see tales, particularly those from Homer, as serious enough to justify bowdlerization or allegorization.</p>
		<h3>The works of Hesiod: Theogony and Works and Days</h3>
		<p>The Theogony of Hesiod is the most complete and essential source of mythology regarding the origin of the gods (c. 700 BCE). Folktales and etiological myths accompany the extensive genealogy shown above. Some of these are shared in the context of a farmer's calendar and a long harangue on the subject of justice addressed to Hesiod's perhaps mythical brother Perses in The Works and Days. The orthodox perspective sees the two poems as having completely different themes, and the Works and Days as a theodicy (a natural theology). However, the two poems can be read as a diptych, with each section reliant on the other. The Theogony establishes the gods' identities and associations, while Hesiod's Works and Days offer guidance on how to succeed in a perilous world, with Hesiod arguing that the most reliable—though far from certain—method is to be kind.</p>
		<h3>Other literary works</h3>
		<p>The Homeric Hymns are the source of several important religious myths. Fragmentary post-Homeric epics of varying date and authorship filled in the gaps in the accounts of the Trojan War recorded in the Iliad and Odyssey; the so-called Homeric Hymns (shorter surviving poems) are the source of several important religious myths. Many lyric poets retained myths, but Pindar of Thebes' odes (flourished 6th–5th century BCE) are especially rich in myth and legend. The tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, all of whom lived in the 5th century BCE, are known for preserving a wide range of traditions in their works.</p>
		<p>Callimachus, a poet and scholar in Alexandria during the Hellenistic period (323–30 BCE), documented numerous cryptic traditions; his contemporary, the mythographer Euhemerus, proposed that the gods were originally human, a position known as Euhemerism. Another scholar from the 3rd century BCE, Apollonius of Rhodes, maintained the most detailed account of the Argonauts' quest for the Golden Fleece.</p>
		<p>The Geography of Strabo (1st century BCE), the Library of the pseudo-Apollodorus (attributed to a 2nd-century-CE scholar), the antiquarian writings of Greek biographer Plutarch, and the works of Pausanias, a 2nd-century-CE historian, as well as the Latin Genealogies of Hyginus, a 2nd-century-CE mythographer, have all provided valuable Latin sources of later Greek mythology during the Roman Empire.</p>
		<h3>Archaeological discoveries</h3>
		<p>Heinrich Schliemann, a 19th-century German amateur archaeologist, discovered the Mycenaean civilization, and Sir Arthur Evans, a 20th-century English archaeologist, discovered the Minoan civilization in Crete, both of which are critical to a 21st-century understanding of the development of myth and ritual in the Greek world. These finds shed light on Minoan society from around 2200 to 1450 BCE and Mycenaean civilisation from around 1600 to 1200 BCE; these eras were followed by a Dark Age that lasted until around 800 BCE. Unfortunately, because the Linear B script (an ancient form of Greek found in both Crete and Greece) was primarily employed to record inventories, the evidence for myth and ritual at Mycenaean and Minoan sites is essentially monumental.</p>
		<p>Geometric decorations on 8th-century BCE ceramics portray scenes from the Trojan War as well as Heracles' exploits. The excessive formality of the style, on the other hand, makes much of the identification problematic, and there is no inscriptional evidence to aid researchers in identifying and interpreting the designs. Homeric and other legendary episodes appear to enhance the extant literary evidence in the Archaic (c. 750–c. 500 BCE), Classical (c. 480–323 BCE), and Hellenistic periods.</p>
