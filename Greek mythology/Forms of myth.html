		<h1>Forms of myth in Greek culture</h1>
		<p>It is useful to distinguish between myth, legend, and folktale, but it must be recalled that the Greeks did not do so.</p>
		<h3>Religious myths</h3>
		<p>In their more serious parts, Greek religious tales are concerned with gods or heroes, or are linked to ritual. They include cosmogonical accounts of the gods' emergence from Chaos and the creation of the world, divine ruler successions, and intramural battles that resulted in Zeus' supremacy as Olympus' reigning god (the mountain that was considered the home of the gods). They also tell of Zeus' long affair with gods and mortal women, which frequently culminated in the birth of younger deities and heroes. The myths of Apollo explain that god's sacral associations, describe his remarkable victories over monsters and giants, and stress his jealousy and the dangers inherent in immortal alliances; and the goddess Athena's unique status is implicit in the story of her motherless birth (she sprang full-grown from Zeus's forehead)</p>
		<p>Dionysus myths, on the other hand, show the animosity engendered by a new faith. Some stories are strongly tied with rituals, such as Hera's annual restoration of her virginity by bathing in the spring Canathus, or the narrative of the Curetes, Zeus' attendants, smothering the infant Zeus' cries by clashing their weapons. Some hero and heroine myths are based on religious beliefs. The myth of the Four Ages includes a story about creation and moral deterioration (see below Myths of the ages of the world). The deluge that followed the destruction of humanity and the subsequent regeneration of humans from stones is based on a folktale.</p>
		<h3>Legends</h3>
		<p>Legends (or sagas) were considered quasi-historical, whilst myths were thought to reflect divine or everlasting truths. As a result, renowned events in epics, such as the Trojan War, were widely believed to have occurred, and heroes and heroines were thought to have lived. Earlier sagas, such as the Argonauts' expedition, were accepted in the same way. The majority of Greek legends are filled with folktales and fiction, however some do have a historical basis. Such are the stories of many sacks of Troy, which are backed up by archaeological evidence, and Heracles' labors, which could indicate Mycenaean feudalism. Exaggerated stories of bull leaping in ancient Crete may have spawned the legend of the Minotaur (a monster half human, half bull).</p>
		<p>Heinous crimes, such as attempting to rape a goddess, tricking the gods by incriminating them in crime, or taking their prerogatives, were punished in another class of mythology by eternal suffering in the underworld. Legends also detailed the consequences of social crimes such as murder or incest (e.g., the story of Oedipus, who killed his father and married his mother). Legends were also used to defend existing political institutions and to support territorial claims.</p>
		<h3>Folktales</h3>
		<p>Folktales, which are stories with repeating themes that are recited for entertainment, naturally found their way into Greek mythology. Lost folks, whether husbands, wives, or children (e.g., Odysseus, Helen of Troy, or Paris of Troy), are frequently found or retrieved after long and dramatic journeys. Orpheus (a hero who journeyed to Hades to restore his dead bride, Eurydice, to the world of the living), Heracles, Odysseus, and Theseus all made journeys to the region of the dead (the slayer of the Minotaur). The triumph of the little man over impossible odds via ingenuity, the deeds of the superhuman (e.g., Heracles), or the long-awaited victory over adversaries are still as popular among current writers as they were among the Greeks.</p>
		<p>The effective foiling of cruel sires and stepmothers, the rescuing of princesses from monsters, and temporary forgetfulness at a critical juncture are all common themes in Greek mythology. Another popular folktale feature is recognition by markers, such as Odysseus' scar or quirks of dress. The babes-in-the-woods idea of youngsters being exposed and then recovering can also be seen in Greek mythology. The Greeks, on the other hand, were well aware of kid exposure as a frequent practice.</p>
