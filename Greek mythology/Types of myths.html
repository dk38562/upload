			<h1>Types of myths in Greek culture</h1>
			<h3>Myths of origin</h3>
			<p>Origin myths are an attempt to make the universe understandable in human terms. Greek cosmogonies (creation myths) and cosmologies (universal ideas) were more methodical and specific than those of other ancient peoples. Yet, because the Greeks supplemented the myths with folktales and fiction recounted for its own reason, their creativity serves as a hindrance to interpretation. Though the purpose of Hesiod's Theogony is to describe Zeus' ascension (and, by extension, the rise of the other gods), the inclusion of familiar themes such as generational rivalry, the enigma of woman (Pandora), the exploits of the friendly trickster (Prometheus), and battles against powerful beings or monsters such as the Titans adds to the epic's interest.</p>
			<p>According to Hesiod, the Gap (Chaos), Earth (Gaea), the Abyss (Tartarus), and Love were the first divine beings to appear (Eros). Gaea was forcibly separated from her adoring consort Heaven (Uranus) in order for her progeny to be born, which began the creative process. The method of separation used, Uranus's genitals being cut off by his son Cronus, is reminiscent of a similar story documented in Babylonian epic. The crudity is mitigated, however, in typical Greek manner, by Uranus and Gaea's cordial collaboration on a scheme to save Zeus from the same Cronus, his cannibalistic sire, following their divorce.</p>
			<p>The Earth was envisioned as a flat disk afloat on the river of Ocean in Greek cosmological conceptions. At night, the Sun (Helios) sailed around the Earth in a golden bowl, traversing the heavens like a charioteer. Natural cracks were once thought to be portals to Hades's underground residence, i.e., the afterlife.</p>
			<h3>Myths of the ages of the world</h3>
			<p>Greek myths appear to have been vulnerable to critique and revision from a very early period, based on morality or misrepresentation of known facts. Hesiod uses a Four Ages (or Races) plan in his Works and Days: Golden, Silver, Bronze, and Iron. Although "Race" is a more appropriate translation, "Golden Age" has grown so common in English that both terms should be stated. These races or centuries are different creations of the gods, with the Golden Age belonging to Cronus' rule and the following races to Zeus'. The Golden Age people never grew old, were free of toil, and spent their time laughing and feasting. They became guardian spirits on Earth after they died.</p>
			<p>Hesiod was unable to explain why the Golden Age came to an end, but the Silver Age took its place. The men of the Silver Age began to act presumptuously and neglected the gods after an excessively extended childhood. As a result, Zeus imprisoned them on Earth, where they evolved into spirits among the dead.</p>
			<p>The men of the Bronze Age were then formed by Zeus, warriors of ferocity who died in a mutually destructive war. The Age of Heroes is interpolated at this time by the poet. In the interests of history, he breaks the myth's symmetry: what is now known as the Minoan-Mycenaean period was widely thought to have been a good time to live in antiquity. (Though not ubiquitous in Greece, Hesiod, Xenophanes, Pindar, Aeschylus, and Plato are among those who subject myth to history.) Under the leadership of Cronus (driven into honorable exile by his son Zeus) in the Isles of the Blessed, the more fortunate (who were related to the gods) resorted to a kind of restored Golden Age existence.</p>
			<p>The poet himself had the misfortune to live during the Iron Age, which was the polar opposite of the Golden Age. But that wasn't the worst of it; he believed that there would come a time when infants would be born elderly, and there would be no way to stop the world's moral deterioration. Pandora's hasty conduct in opening the deadly jar explained the presence of evil.</p>
			<p>The idea in succeeding times or races is seen everywhere in Greek and Roman literature, along with the conviction that, when the worst is achieved, the system will gradually (Plato, Politikos) or rapidly (Virgil, Fourth Eclogue) return to the Golden Age. Hesiod may have been aware of this story; he wishes he had been born sooner or later. There is also a narrative of development linked with Prometheus, the god of craftsmen, but the progress is restricted since Greek thought lacks the 19th-century concept of endless advancement.</p>
			<h3>Myths of the gods</h3>
			<p>The gods' births, battles over monsters or competitors, love affairs, special powers, or affiliations with a cultic place or rite were all described in myths about them. Because these powers were often broad, many gods' mythologies were similarly complicated. The Homeric Hymns to Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, and to the Delian and Pythian Apollo, for example, explain how these gods came to be connected with Eleusis, Delos, and Delphi, respectively. Similarly, myths about Athena, the patroness of Athens, emphasize the goddess's love of war and her affection for heroes and the city of Athens, while myths about Hermes (the gods' messenger), Aphrodite (goddess of love), or Dionysus emphasize Hermes' proclivities as a god of thieves, Aphrodite's lovemaking, and Dionysus' association with wine, frenzy, miracles, and Poseidon (god of the sea) was especially atavistic in that his relationship with Earth, as well as his equestrian exploits, seem to harken back to his pre-marine past as a horse or earthquake deity.</p>
			<p>Many myths are dismissed as frivolous and lighthearted, but this assessment is based on the unspoken assumption that any divine behavior that seems out of place in a major religion must have appeared absurd and fictitious to the Greeks. Homer hardly mentions the judgment of Paris, but he was well aware of the far-reaching ramifications for Troy of Aphrodite's favor and Hera and Athena's violent rivalry, which the "judgment of Paris" was written to explain.</p>
			<p>With the passage of time, a slew of smaller myths arose to support the earlier, more true ones. Thus, Apollo's loves, which Homer and Hesiod largely disregarded, explained why the bay (or laurel) became Apollo's sacred tree and how he came to father Asclepius, a curing deity. Fables also described the presence of the cuckoo on Hera's sceptre at Hermione and the development of the panpipe. During the Hellenistic era, such etiological stories flourished, however authentic examples are difficult to come by in earlier periods.</p>
			<p>The nymphs (nature goddesses) were folk deities who symbolized nature or life in water or trees and were thought to punish unfaithful lovers. Water nymphs (Naiads) were said to drown people who fell in love with them, including Heracles' companion Hylas. Even the benign Muses (goddesses of the arts and sciences), such as the bard Thamyris, blinded their human opponents. The male counterparts of the nymphs were satyrs (young folk deities with bestial traits) and sileni (old and inebriated folk deities). Sileni, like sea deities, possessed hidden knowledge that they would only reveal under duress. Charon, the gruesome ferryman of the dead, was also a well-known folklore figure.</p>
			<h3>Myths of heroes</h3>
			<p>Hero myths included aspects of legend, folklore, and fiction. The Argonauts' narrative, for example, is extremely complicated and contains aspects of both folklore and fiction. The departure of the Greek fleet from Aulis, or Theseus' Cretan voyage and death on Scyros, may be based on Minoan-Mycenaean myths. On the other hand, the Iliad's events are likely to owe far more to Homer's inventiveness than to actual tradition. Even legendary heroes like Achilles, Hector, and Diomedes are mostly made up, though they are undoubtedly based on mythical predecessors. The Odyssey is a great example of folktales being imported wholesale into epic. All of the most well-known Greek hero myths, such as Heracles' labors and the exploits of Perseus, Cadmus, Pelops, and Oedipus, are based on folktales rather than mythology.</p>
			<p>Certain heroes, such as Heracles, the Dioscuri (the twins Castor and Pollux), Amphiaraus (one of the Argonauts), and Hyacinthus (a young man whom Apollo adored and accidentally killed), may be considered part folklore, part religious myth. While Heracles, a Tiryns man, may have been a historical figure at one time, the legend of his death on Oeta and subsequent elevation to full divinity is strongly associated with a cult. Heracles' popularity eventually led to his story being linked to the Argonauts, a previous invasion on Troy, and Theban myth. Similarly, the Dioscuri's adventures are typical of heroes: fighting, kidnapping women, and cattle rustling. Following their deaths, they spent six months alternately beneath the Earth and above it, implying that their worship, like that of Persephone (Zeus and Demeter's daughter), was linked to fertility or seasonal change.</p>
			<h3>Myths of seasonal renewal</h3>
			<p>Certain tales about goddesses or heroes being imprisoned in the underworld for a season were allegories of seasonal regeneration. The story of how Hades (Latin Pluto), the god of the underworld, whisked Persephone away to be his bride, forcing her mother, Demeter, the goddess of grain, to let the land to become barren as a result of her grief, is perhaps the most well-known myth of this type. Persephone was allowed to spend four months of the year in Hades and eight months in the light of day because of her mother's sadness. She was believed to spend six months of the year in each of the less pleasant climates. Some academics believe Persephone's underground sojourn corresponds to the summer months, when Greek fields are dry and barren, yet the myth's earliest source, the Hymn to Demeter, specifically indicates that Persephone returns when the spring flowers are blooming (line 401). Seasonal renewal myths abound, in which the deity dies and reincarnates at specific times of the year. The above-mentioned Cretan Zeus is an important Greek example.</p>
			<h3>Myths involving animal transformations</h3>
			<p>Animal transformations appear in many Greek stories, yet there is no evidence that theriolatry (animal worship) was ever practiced by the Greeks. To fool goddesses or women, gods would occasionally take the guise of creatures. When Zeus kidnapped Europa, a Phoenician princess, he disguised himself as a bull, and when he courted Leda, the wife of a Spartan king, he disguised himself as a swan. Poseidon assumed the form of a stallion in order to give birth to the legendary horses Arion and Pegasus.</p>
			<p>These legends do not imply theriolatry. There is no worship made to the deity in question. In the stories, the animals have additional functions. Bulls were the most powerful creatures known to the Greeks, and they may have formerly been venerated. For the Greeks, however, there is no evidence that Zeus or Poseidon were once bulls or horses, that Hera was ever "ox-eyed" other than symbolically, or that "gray-eyed" Athena was ever "owl-faced" in even the earliest texts.</p>
			<h3>Other types</h3>
			<p>Other sorts of myths exemplified the concept that the gods occasionally appeared on Earth disguised as men and women, and that any assistance or hospitality shown to them was rewarded. For example, by serving hospitality to Zeus and Hermes, both of whom were in human form, Baucis, an elderly Phrygian woman, and Philemon, her husband, were spared from a flood.</p>
			<p>Several myths recount the penalty meted out to mortals who pretended to be gods' superiors, whether in musical ability or in the number of their children. The gods' jealously of mankind' musical abilities is manifested in Athena and Apollo's beating and flaying of the aulos-playing satyr Marsyas, as well as the affixing of ass's ears to King Midas for failing to recognize Apollo's superiority over the god Pan's song. Because Niobe flaunted her fecundity to the goddess Leto, who had only two kids, jealousy drove the slaughter of Niobe's many children. Moral tales about the fate of Icarus, who flew too high on homemade wings, or the fable about Phaethon, the son of Helios, who failed to complete a task too difficult for him, are similar to such legends (controlling the horses of the chariot of the Sun).</p>
			<p>Transformation into a flower or tree, whether to avoid a god's embrace (as with Daphne, a nymph transformed into a laurel tree), as a result of an accident (as with Hyacinthus, an Apollo friend who was changed into a flower), or out of pride (as with Narcissus, a beautiful youth who fell in love with his own reflection and was changed into a flower) was a common theme in Greek myth.</p>
			<p>Fairytale places, such as the Garden of the Hesperides (in the far west) or the kingdom of the Hyperboreans (in the far north), or encounters with strange species, such as Centaurs, or separate cultures, such as the Amazons, were also popular.</p>
			<h3>Greek mythological characters and motifs in art and literature</h3>
			<p>The deceptive simplicity of Greek tales has moved and perplexed Western people throughout history, and Greek mythology has had a significant impact on the formation of Western culture.</p>
			<p>Late Mycenaean and sub-Mycenaean art contain the earliest artistic representations of mythical characters and motifs. Centaurs, a siren, and even Zeus's lover Europa have been identified, though identification is debatable. Mythological and epic themes can also be found in 8th century BCE Geometric art, but it wasn't until the 7th century that these subjects were popular in both pottery and sculptured works. They became commonplace during the Classical and later periods. The narrative of Pelops and Heracles' labors were the subjects of the corresponding pediment and the metopes (the gaps between the triglyphs on a Doric frieze) of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, while the birth of Athena was the subject of the east pediment of the Parthenon in Athens. Gods battling Giants and Lapiths (a mountain tribe in northern Greece) battling Centaurs were also popular themes. Theseus and Ariadne, Perseus, Icarus' fall, and Pyramus' death are all depicted realistically in Pompeian frescoes.</p>
			<p>Greek mythology was given a new dimension by the great Renaissance masters. Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's Ledas, and Raphael's Galatea are among the most well-known subjects of Italian artists.</p>
			<p>Greek myth impacted writers such as Dante and Petrarch in Italy, Geoffrey Chaucer in England, and subsequently, the English Elizabethans and John Milton, through the medium of Latin and, above all, Ovid's works. In France, Jean Racine and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe revived Greek play, while practically all of the main English poets, from William Shakespeare to Robert Bridges, looked to Greek mythology for inspiration. In following centuries, prominent dramatists such as Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, and Jean Giraudoux in France, Eugene O'Neill in America, and T.S. Eliot in England, as well as notable novelists such as James Joyce (Irish) and André Gide in France, reinterpreted Classical subjects (French). Many composers have adapted Greek legendary subjects to music, including German composers Christoph Gluck (18th century) and Richard Strauss (20th century), German-French composer Jacques Offenbach (19th century), Russian composer Igor Stravinsky (20th century), and many others.</p>
