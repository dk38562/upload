			<h1>Types of myths in Greek culture</h1>
			<h3>Myths of origin</h3>
			<p>Origin myths are an attempt to make the universe understandable in human terms. Greek cosmogonies (creation myths) and cosmologies (universal ideas) were more organized and specific than those of other ancient peoples. Yet, because the Greeks supplemented the myths with folktales and fiction recounted for their own reason, their creativity hinders interpretation. Though the purpose of Hesiod's Theogony is to describe Zeus' ascension and, by extension, the rise of the other gods. The inclusion of familiar themes such as generational rivalry, the enigma of a woman (Pandora), the exploits of the friendly trickster (Prometheus), and battles against powerful beings or monsters such as the Titans add to the epic's interest.</p>
			<h3>Myths of the ages of the world</h3>
			<p>Hesiod could not explain why the Golden Age came to an end, but the Silver Age took its place. The people of the Silver Age began to act arrogantly and neglected the gods after an excessively extended childhood. As a result, Zeus imprisoned them on Earth, where they evolved into spirits among the dead.</p>
			<p>The men of the Bronze Age were then formed by Zeus, warriors of ferocity who died in a mutually destructive war. The Age of Heroes is now known as the Minoan-Mycenaean period. It was widely thought to have been an excellent time to live in antiquity. Under the leadership of Cronus (driven into honorable exile by his son Zeus) in the Isles of the Blessed, the more fortunate (who were related to the gods) resorted to a kind of restored Golden Age existence.</p>
			<h3>Myths of the gods</h3>
			<p>The gods' births, battles over monsters or competitors, love affairs, special powers, or affiliations with a cultic place or rite were all described in myths. Because these powers were often broad, many gods' mythologies were similarly complicated. Many myths are dismissed as frivolous and lighthearted. Still, this assessment is based on the unspoken assumption that any divine behavior that seems out of place in a significant religion must have appeared absurd and fictitious to the Greeks.</p>
			<h3>Myths of heroes</h3>
			<p>Hero myths included aspects of the legend, folklore, and fiction. The Argonauts' narrative, for example, is highly complicated and contains elements of both folklore and fantasy. The departure of the Greek fleet from Aulis, or Theseus' Cretan voyage and death on Scyros, may be based on Minoan-Mycenaean myths. On the other hand, the Iliad's events owe far more to Homer's inventiveness than actual tradition. Even legendary heroes like Achilles, Hector, and Diomedes are mostly made up, though undoubtedly based on mythical predecessors. All of the most well-known Greek hero myths, such as Heracles' labors and the exploits of Perseus, Cadmus, Pelops, and Oedipus, are based on folktales rather than mythology. Certain heroes may be considered part folklore and part religious myth.</p>
			<p>While Heracles, a Tiryns man, may have been a historical figure. The legend of his death on Oeta and subsequent elevation to full divinity is strongly associated with a cult. Heracles' popularity eventually led to his story being linked to the Argonauts, a previous invasion of Troy, and the Theban myth.</p>
			<h3>Other types</h3>
			<p>Other myths exemplified that the gods occasionally appeared on Earth disguised as men and women. Any assistance or hospitality shown to them was rewarded. For example, by serving hospitality to Zeus and Hermes, both of whom were in human form, Baucis, an elderly Phrygian woman, and Philemon, her husband, were spared from a flood. Several myths recount the penalty meted out to mortals who pretended to be gods' superiors, whether in musical ability or in the number of their children.</p>
