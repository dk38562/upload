			<h1>Forms of myth in Greek culture</h1>
			<p>It is helpful to distinguish between myth, legend, and folktale, but it's important to remember that the Greeks did not do so.</p>
			<h3>Religious myths</h3>

			<p>Greek religious tales are concerned with gods, heroes, or rituals in their more severe parts. They include accounts of: the gods' emergence from Chaos, the world's creation, divine ruler successions, and battles that resulted in Zeus' supremacy as Olympus' reigning god (the mountain considered the home of the gods). They also tell of Zeus' long affair with gods and mortal women, which frequently culminated in the birth of younger deities and heroes.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, Dionysus myths show the hatred engendered by a new faith. Some stories are strongly tied with rituals, such as Hera's annual restoration of her virginity by bathing in the spring Canathus or the narrative of the Curetes, Zeus' attendants, smothering the infant Zeus' cries by clashing their weapons. Some hero and heroine myths are based on religious beliefs. The legend of the Four Ages includes a story about creation and moral deterioration.</p>
			<h3>Legends</h3>
			<p>Many consider legends (or sagas) quasi-historical, while myths are thought to reflect divine or everlasting truths. Consequently, renowned events in epics, such as the Trojan War, were widely believed to have occurred, and heroes and heroines were likely accurate. Earlier sagas, such as the Argonauts' expedition, were accepted similarly. Most Greek legends are filled with folktales and fiction; however, some have a historical basis. Such are the stories of many sacks of Troy, backed up by archaeological evidence, and Heracles' labors, which could indicate Mycenaean feudalism. Exaggerated accounts of bull-leaping in ancient Crete may have spawned the legend of the Minotaur (a monster half-human, half-bull).</p>
			<p>Heinous crimes, such as tricking the gods by incriminating them in crime, or taking their authority, were punished in another mythology class by eternal suffering in the underworld. Legends also detailed the consequences of social crimes such as murder or incest. Greek politicians also used them to defend existing political institutions and support territorial claims.</p>
			<h3>Folktales</h3>
			<p>Folktales, stories with repeating themes recited for entertainment, naturally found their way into Greek mythology. Whether husbands, wives, or children (e.g., Odysseus, Helen of Troy, or Paris of Troy), lost folks are frequently found or retrieved after long and dramatic journeys. Orpheus, Heracles, Odysseus, and Theseus all made journeys to the region of the dead (the slayer of the Minotaur). The hero's triumph over impossible odds, the deeds of a superhuman (e.g., Heracles), or a long-awaited victory over adversaries are still as popular among current writers as they were among the Greeks.</p>
			<p>The effective foiling of cruel sires and stepmothers, the rescuing of princesses from monsters, and temporary forgetfulness at a critical juncture are all common themes in Greek mythology. </p>
