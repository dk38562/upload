			<a href="https://web.cs.dal.ca/~johnston/poetry/island.html">No Man is an Island</a><br>
			By John Donne
		</header>
<pre>
No man is an island entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 
own were; any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 
And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 
</pre>
